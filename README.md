## Requirements
You need to have FSUIPC/XPUIPC installed!

## Installation
1) Download the latest FSX Rich Presence from [here](https://github.com/1Revenger1/fsxrichpresenceapp/releases)
2) Unzip the zip and it will work!

If you want this to start with your flight simulator, you will need to go to your fsuipc.ini, which for FSX is in "/Modules" within the root FSX folder. P3D should have their fsuipc.ini in a similar place.
